# Digital Reef

**Place-based intelligence for well-being in Aotearoa New Zealand**

Digital Reef is shared civic technology infrastructure that supports recreation, environmental stewardship, and community well-being organisations across Aotearoa. We build tools that make regulatory processes more legible, reduce information asymmetry, and help communities document and defend the places they care about.

## What We Do

New Zealand's regulatory and civic landscape is fragmented. Notices, consultations, and decisions affecting communities are scattered across dozens of agencies and portals. The organisations that care most - recreation clubs, conservation groups, search and rescue teams - often lack the resources to monitor what's happening or to capture their knowledge in forms that planners can use.

Digital Reef addresses this gap by providing shared digital infrastructure that these organisations could not build independently.

## Our Tools

**Nemo** is an environmental and civic notice-monitoring system. It continuously monitors public regulatory sources across Aotearoa, surfacing early-stage signals of decisions affecting communities. Nemo provides situational awareness - not commentary or advocacy.

**Aronnax** is a participatory GIS platform for field data collection. It enables well-being groups and communities to capture geolocated observations, building spatial assets that make recreation use, access patterns, and place-based values visible to decision-makers.

**The Digital Reef** itself is the GIS-centred spatial data backbone that integrates these tools into defensible, decision-relevant outputs for planning, submissions, and long-term stewardship.

## Principles

Digital Reef is **infrastructural, not advocacy**. We surface information and provide tools; humans and organisations decide what to do with it.

We are committed to:

-   Reducing information asymmetry between well-resourced actors and community groups
-   Transparency in methods, classification, and limitations
-   Respecting democratic processes, expert judgement, and local knowledge
-   Te Mana Raraunga Maori Data Sovereignty principles as governance architecture
-   Open, interoperable technologies and data formats

## Who We Serve

Digital Reef supports a diverse community of users including volunteer recreation clubs, community conservation groups, search and rescue teams, accessibility organisations, iwi and hapu, researchers, local government, and commercial users in the planning and resource management sector. Access is tiered so that commercial revenue cross-subsidises community benefit.

## Current Status

Nemo is operational and monitoring key New Zealand regulatory sources. We are in alpha testing with partner organisations and working toward public launch in 2026. Aronnax is in active development planning.

Digital Reef operates as a New Zealand trust with charitable registration underway.
